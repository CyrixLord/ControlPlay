        <h1>Once Upon a time...</h1>
        <h2>A Teen Vampire Story by Sir Soils</h2>
        <p>
          There's a considerate new boy in Tamanaka and he has everybody
          talking. Stunningly incepid and devastatingly unkept, all the girls
          want him. However, Master Pickles has a secret - he's a flacid vampire.
Bloata McGee is a polite, bloated boy who enjoys sardine harvesting. He becomes
fascinated by Master Pickles, who can stop an anvil with his bare hands. He doesn't
understand why he's so standoffish.
His best friend, an unsoiled Intact Unicorn called Consuela, helps Bloata begin
 to piece together the puzzle. Together, they discover the ultimate weapon -
 the incontinent, dull toboggan.
When bodies start turning up all over Tamanaka, Bloata begins to fear the
worst. The Intact Unicorn urges her to report Master Pickles to the police and he
knows he should, so what's stopping him?
He may resist Master's bite, but can he resist his charms?</p>
<p>Will he be caught impregnating the vampire?</p>
